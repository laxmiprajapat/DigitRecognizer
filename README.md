# Kaggle: Digit Recognizer

Task: Classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset

Approach: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained using 42 000 28x28 images and the lasagne library in Python. The CNN consists of an input layer, output layer (softmax), 5 convolutional layers (ReLU), 2 max-pooling layers, and a dropout layer.
